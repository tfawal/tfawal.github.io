            <P>
                I am currently attending UC Berkeley, and pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering
                and Computer Science, with a minor in Music.

            <P>
                The second endeavor is that I will be an academic intern for CS61C this summer.  This was my favorite
                computer science course that I have taken at Cal.  This will also help to reinforce my understanding of
                the material in preparation for taking EECS151 in the fall, where I will be making a RISC-V
                computer using an FPGA.  I also hope to become part of the course staff for CS61C and EE105 in the fall 
                semester.

            <P>
                I am beginning my search for an intership next summer of 2023, following my expected graduation
                date.  I am someone that can adapt to and learn anything I set my mind to.  I am a natural leader, and 
                know how to get things done.  I am open to any opportunity that sounds like interesting and 
                inspiring work. That said, anything related to analog and digital integrated circuit design, 
                electric motors, and sound engineering are at the top of my list.  It is exciting to embark on 
                this new journey and find the right company to make this happen with.
