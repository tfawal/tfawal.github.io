            <P>
                I am currently attending UC Berkeley, and pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering
                and Computer Science, with a minor in Music.  I will be graduating in May of 2023.

            <P>
                I am beginning my search for an internship or employment. I am available for a part-time internship
                starting in January 2023 for my last semester at Cal, because I will only be taking one class.  Following
                my expected graduation date I am available for full-time work.

            <P>
                I am someone that can adapt to and learn anything I set my mind to.  I am a natural leader, 
                and know how to get things done.  I am open to any opportunity that sounds like interesting 
                and inspiring work. That said, anything related to analog and digital integrated circuit 
                design, electric motors, and sound engineering are at the top of my list.  It is exciting 
                to embark on this new journey and find the right company to make this happen with.
