            <P>
                I am currently attending UC Berkeley, and pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering
                and Computer Science, with a minor in Music.  I will be graduating in May of 2023.

            <P>
                I am actively searching for an internship during the summer of 2023.  I am considering pursuing a
                graduate degree, but if a company were to offer full-time employment that is something I would also
                consider.

            <P>
                I am someone that can adapt to and learn anything I set my mind to.  I am a natural leader, 
                and know how to get things done.  I am open to any opportunity that sounds like interesting 
                and inspiring work. That said, anything related to analog and digital integrated circuit 
                design is my specialized area of study.
                
            <P>    
                I am especially interested in doing research on new medical devices that can improve the quality of
                people's lives.  It is exciting to embark on this new journey and find the right company to make this
                happen with.

            <H2>Bio</H2>

            <P>
                I was born and raised in San Jose, California until the age of eight.  In 1988 my father got a new job 
                that took us to the dry heat summers of Antioch, back when there were still mostly orchards surrounding 
                us, and a population of ~25,000 people.

            <P>
                I lost interest in academics during high school, instead focusing on football, wrestling, and racing
                cars; and not in that particular order.  I also began to teach myself programming languages for fun, 
                in which I made silly programs using Visual Basic during the America Online era of the Internet.

            <P>
                Barely graduating from Deer Valley HS in 1999, and not knowing what to do with myself, I began to
                attend Diablo Valley College to take computer science classes.  However, I did not enjoy the 
                classroom as much as my bedroom in the middle of the night.  I did not enjoy school, and at that 
                time in my life I was not interested in applying myself.  I was more interested in modifying
                and racing cars.
            
            <P>
                I moved back to San Jose in 2001, working full-time at a gas station while now attending West Valley
                College in Saratoga.  On the weekends I would go to the race tracks with a group of friends that all 
                owned MKIV Toyota Supra turbos.  One of those friends that would significantly alter my
                direction in life.  He loaned me his classical guitar.
            
            <P>
                I quickly became obsessed with learning the guitar and playing music.  I dropped out of college and 
                practiced at all the hours I could when not working at a gas station, delivering flowers, and as a
                security guard at Altera--way back before Intel acquired them.

            <P>
                In 2004 I left San Jose, and moved to a campground in Tuolumne, which is close to Sonora, and about an 
                hour from Yosemite.  I lived a minimal and simple life so that I didn't have to pay many bills.  This way I was 
                able to devote most of my time developing as a musician.  I began cooking to earn a living, and also
                raked pine needles, as it is a lucrative business for folks surrounded by a forest.

            <P>
                In 2007 I moved to San Francisco to attend the Blue Bear School of Music, and began to play with 
                other people in bands.  Through Blue Bear I was blessed to meet Johnny Nitro, who took me under his
                wing and started letting my play with his band throughout the Bay Area, and at the Saloon in North 
                Beach.  The Saloon is one of the oldest blues bars in SF, and Nitro played there every Friday and 
                Saturday night for over twenty years until he passed away in February of 2011.

            <P>
                Johnny passed the torch on to me during those few years I got to know him, and he taught me how to
                really <I>play</I> the guitar, and with other musicians.  I moved to North Beach shortly after he 
                his death, and began playing at the Saloon with my own band that same year.  I feel very fortunate to
                have been able to do so, and I had many great experiences there.

            <P>
                I love music, and I especially love playing music for other people.  When you get into a groove with 
                your bandmates, and the audience responds to you, there is no better feeling in the 
                world.  But for some reason, I started getting the urge to go back to school around 2014.  I always loved
                math and physics when I was in school, even though I didn't apply myself.  I also started feeling age 
                catching up with me, and I was definitely living the starving artist lifestyle.
            <P>
                I had actually registered at City College of SF in the summer of 2014, but I didn't follow through because of 
                a full-time job opportunity that came up.  It was with a start-up company in SF that only lasted six months, and 
                I was back to scraping by in 2015.  I lived that way for two more years, never pulling the trigger on going back
                to school because of feeling like I couldn't afford it.
            <P>
                Then in the summer of 2017 I saw a poster for the new Free City program from CCSF.  Community college tuition was
                going to be free for SF residents starting in the Fall.  Immediately this felt like a sign, and I registered to go 
                back.  I was still working full-time as an assistant head chef of events for Foxtail Catering, so I only went 
                part-time for the first year.  I only started with physics and math (had to start with trigonomery and algebra), and 
                I also always wanted to learn Spanish.  I thought I would just get an AA in physics, so that I would complete a goal, 
                and be done with school.

            <P>
                After the first year my passion for education was reignited.  I kept gradually increasing my units each semester,
                and at the same time decreasing the hours I worked.  Eventually engineering became the path I chose, because it
                combines math, physics, and actually fabricating physical things.  I was not expecting to get accepted to
                UC Berkeley, in fact I was really just hoping that San Jose State would be in the cards.  But I decided to apply
                anyways, and fortunately I was.  I had to sacrifice playing at the Saloon, or any live music gigs for almost three
                years now.  It has been an arduous journey, but well worth it.  I am also able to make my own amplifiers and
                guitars now.  How cool is that?
