        <H1>Welcome to the Homepage of Tarik Fawal</H1>

            <H2>About</H2>
                <P>I am pursuing a BS degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, with a minor in Music.  I am also currently taking summer courses that will fulfill the requirements to obtain the Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation.  I expect to graduate in May of 2023.

                <P>I am an older returning student with a lot of work and life experience that I bring to the table.  I love using tools and working with my hands.  I held many jobs in construction and cooking, while simultaneously honing my skills as a musician for many years before returning to school.  I returned to school because I love physics and wanted to speak Spanish.  My passion for school was reignited, and it turned into a path that has somehow led me to UC Berkeley.   I never expected to be here, and I'm looking forward to a new phase in my life.

                <P>I am someone that can adapt to and learn anything I set my mind to.  I am a natural leader, and know how to get things done.  I am open to any opportunity that sounds like interesting and inspiring work. That said, anything related to analog and digital integrated circuit design, electric motors, and sound engineering are at the top of my list.  It is exciting to embark on this new journey and find the right company to make this happen with.
