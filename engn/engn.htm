            In 2020 I receieved an associates's degree in engineering from the City College of San Francisco, and
            in 2023 I received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley.  During my time
            at UC Berkeley I became involved with research in Professor Salahuddin's spintronics group, and my advisor
            was PhD candidate Jason Hsu.  I also became involved in research of analog and RF communications at the
            Berkeley Wireless Research Center under the advisement of  Professor Ali Niknejad.  Click to the left
